# # Day and Night Image Classifier
# ---
#
# The day/night image dataset consists of 200 RGB color images in two
# categories: day and night.  There are equal numbers of each example: 100 day
# images and 100 night images.
#
# We'd like to build a classifier that can accurately label these images as day
# or night, and that relies on finding distinguishing features between the two
# types of images!
#
# *Note: All images come from the [AMOS
# dataset](http://cs.uky.edu/~jacobs/datasets/amos/) (Archive of Many Outdoor
# Scenes).*
#

# ### Import resources
#
# Before you get started on the project code, import the libraries and
# resources that you'll need.

# In[1]:

import cv2 # computer vision library
import helpers

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg

#get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')


# ## Training and Testing Data
# The 200 day/night images are separated into training and testing datasets.
#
# * 60% of these images are training images, for you to use as you create a
# classifier.
# * 40% are test images, which will be used to test the accuracy of your
# classifier.
#
# First, we set some variables to keep track of some where our images are
# stored:
#
#     image_dir_training: the directory where our training image data is stored
#     image_dir_test: the directory where our test image data is stored

# In[2]:


# Image data directories
image_dir_training = "images/day_night_images/training/"
image_dir_test = "images/day_night_images/test/"


# ## Load the datasets
#
# These first few lines of code will load the training day/night images and
# store all of them in a variable, `IMAGE_LIST`.  This list contains the images
# and their associated label ("day" or "night").
#
# For example, the first image-label pair in `IMAGE_LIST` can be accessed by
# index:
# ``` IMAGE_LIST[0][:]```.
#

# In[4]:


# Using the load_dataset function in helpers.py
# Load training data
IMAGE_LIST = helpers.load_dataset(image_dir_training)

# # 1.  Visualize the input images
#

# In[14]:


# Print out 1.  The shape of the image and 2.  The image's label

# Select an image and its label by list index
image_index = 0
selected_image = IMAGE_LIST[image_index][0]
selected_label = IMAGE_LIST[image_index][1]

# Display image and data about it
plt.imshow(selected_image)
print("Shape: " + str(selected_image.shape))
print("Label: " + str(selected_label))


# # 2.  Pre-process the Data
#
# After loading in each image, you have to standardize the input and output!
#

# ---
# ### Input
#
# It's important to make all your images the same size so that they can be sent
# through the same pipeline of classification steps!  Every input image should
# be in the same format, of the same size, and so on.
#
# #### TODO: Standardize the input images
#
# * Resize each image to the desired input size: 600x1100px (hxw).

# In[ ]:


# This function should take in an RGB image and return a new, standardized
# version
def standardize_input(image):
    
    ## TODO: Resize image so that all "standard" images are the same size
    ## 600x1100 (hxw)
    standard_im = []
    
    return standard_im
    


# ### TODO: Standardize the output
#
# With each loaded image, you also need to specify the expected output.  For
# this, use binary numerical values 0/1 = night/day.

# In[ ]:


# Examples:
# encode("day") should return: 1
# encode("night") should return: 0
def encode(label):
        
    numerical_val = 0
    ## TODO: complete the code to produce a numerical label
    
    return numerical_val


# ## Construct a `STANDARDIZED_LIST` of input images and output labels.
#
# This function takes in a list of image-label pairs and outputs a
# **standardized** list of resized images and numerical labels.
#
# This uses the functions you defined above to standardize the input and
# output, so those functions must be complete for this standardization to work!
#

# In[ ]:

def standardize(image_list):
    
    # Empty image data array
    standard_list = []

    # Iterate through all the image-label pairs
    for item in image_list:
        image = item[0]
        label = item[1]

        # Standardize the image
        standardized_im = standardize_input(image)

        # Create a numerical label
        binary_label = encode(label)    

        # Append the image, and it's one hot encoded label to the full,
        # processed list of image data
        standard_list.append((standardized_im, binary_label))
        
    return standard_list

# Standardize all training images
STANDARDIZED_LIST = standardize(IMAGE_LIST)


# ## Visualize the standardized data
#
# Display a standardized image from STANDARDIZED_LIST.

# In[ ]:


# Display a standardized image and its label

# Select an image by index
image_num = 0
selected_image = STANDARDIZED_LIST[image_num][0]
selected_label = STANDARDIZED_LIST[image_num][1]

# Display image and data about it
## TODO: Make sure the images have numerical labels and are of the same size
plt.imshow(selected_image)
print("Shape: " + str(selected_image.shape))
print("Label [1 = day, 0 = night]: " + str(selected_label))
